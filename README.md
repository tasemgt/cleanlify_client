Cleanlify User (Frontend) Application with React/Nextjs
========
This project features the designing and building the Frontend Application for Cleanlify.


Steps to SETUP Project
================

Prequisites:
- Nodejs >= 22

1. **Prepare Code & Environment**
   
   - Clone the project repo and navigate to the root directory
     
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/tasemgt/cleanlify_client.git
     cd cleanlify_client
     ```
     
   - Open in vscode for better coding management & experience. We will remain in this project directory and run our code from here.
  
   - Ensure you have nodejs installed with Node version >= 22 and npm >= 10. You can confirm this using the commands in the terminal.
     
     ```
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```
     
   - Once you have the correct versions, install dependencies (React, Next, ....) with the command. This will create a `node_modules` directory with installed dependencies.
     
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the application (Dev mode).
     If successful, you should see ` - Local: http://localhost:3000` (Do not close the terminal as this is our server running)
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

2. If you get to this point, your React Front end Application is completely set up and is ready to be used.
